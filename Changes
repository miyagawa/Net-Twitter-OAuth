Revision history for Perl extension Net::Twitter::OAuth

0.04  Tue May 19 01:25:43 PDT 2009
        - Removed mentions to OAuth related shortcuts in the document in favor of using $client->oauth to
          deal with those authentication parameters. The old code continues to work. See perldoc
          Net::OAuth::Simple for details.
        - Rewrote and added a complete example for desktop and web applications how to authorize users.

        - Don't send 'source' param in update since Twitter takes OAuth client's setting for 'from'
